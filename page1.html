							<p>NakedBox is a web and mobile product that introduces users to raw snacks through a monthly subscription or the ability to purchase boxes individually. The goal of NakedBox is to change how users eat, shop, and learn about raw snacks. The solution was brought to life through rigorous user research, ideation, testing and strategic visual elements.</p>

							<p>The idea for NakedBox came from my love for food. Not just any food, but raw food! It is unprocessed raw food that can help revitalize the body and mind the purest way possible.</p>

						<div class="section__body">
							<p>I started to look at some of the top organic and healthy food brands out there. I wanted to study how these brands are helping customers with their goals in terms of cost efficiency, healthy options, and products. First, Nature box seemed to be more of a market with subscriptions and curated boxes. Graze, on the other hand, is more geared towards subscriptions and other options as well like dips, jelly, etc. Thrive market has plentiful options and is more of a grocery membership online market. They claim to have many healthy options, but customers are left with questions on products they don’t know about. I realized quickly that there are many healthy options out there, and it can get pretty costly once everything sums up. Subscription boxes starting at a low monthly rate which includes samplers was the route I decided to take. I gathered my thoughts and started to concept built around subscription boxes and curated boxes for the sake of cost efficiency and simplified decision-making. Studying and comparing these brands gave me the insights to explore how I can bring super healthy food to a whole new level.</p>

						<p>My goal was to eliminate decision-making and my first initial concept was to create a healthy shopping experience based on editors and reviews.  After doing multiple tests on Invisionapp user testing, users were confused to as what the my initial concept was selling. I created the test below and instructed the user to go about the goals. The video shows the user experiencing my initial concept and her frustrations.</p>

						<p>I learned from her experience as well as others. I then brainstormed several ideas until I landed on “NakedBox” which would sell raw snacks. The word “naked” would signify it’s simple and pure form of expression. Based on my research and competitive analysis, I have not seen any brand tapped into specializing in raw snacks. I also had the idea of having a donation part after purchases. The theme would be super healthy and minimal ingredient raw snacks in a box, at an efficient price that donates.</p>

							<p>I started out with rough sketches on paper and just drew whatever came to mind. The word-map strategy definitely helped me gather words that I had not thought of. NakedBox needed to capture a feeling of energy and enlightenment. The color needs to be engaging and vibrant. It would embody a unique symbol to help make it memorable. Simply, the word “Nakedbox” would not do. What if the word “Naked” was crossed out? What if the word was blurred out as to censoring up a certain area. Then, it would be too hard to read the word, Naked. So, I settled upon a tree that would be pixelated!</p>

						<p>It’s quick, simple, and easy to throw away. I brainstormed how users would go through this site. I then walked users through the user flow. Users made comments about not liking to create accounts before checkout and payment. However, they understood when purchasing subscription plans, it was necessary to create an account. Another comment that I found interesting was, they would rather have a curated box and not spend time researching on products when “sending gift” or purchasing for themselves. Lastly, users were not too fond of adding friends and having a community, as it would be too much work and could get complicated. I gathered my thoughts together from my user’s feedback, and moved forward to creating user flows on Sketch design tool.</p>

						<p>The feedback from my paper prototype allowed me to make changes for a more refined user flow using Sketch. In Sketch, I created a user flow for “subscribing to a monthly plan” and “shopping individual boxes”. I then gathered a few users and talked them through each user flow. All the users seem to understand the process as it was clear and simple.</p>

					<div class="section__body">
						<p>As a result, I made sure the design would incorporate something very simple. The homepage would say it all and as user’s scroll down, they would exactly know what this website is about. I made sure to include 2 CTA in the Hero section and also at the bottom so that users have the convenience of finding them. Creating a user experience that tells a story from beginning to end was my goal and it succeeded in my peek user testing.</p>

						<p>To answer these questions from users, I designed the product detail page to have a section of a ZIP code so users can input their location. I tested the product detail page out in Invisionapp and all users did not have a problem finding and inputting their ZIP code.</p>

						<p>When I got to the shopping cart and checkout section, I created the user experience to be super friendly and convenient to the user. This isn’t your typical Amazon or eBay where account registration is favored. I needed to create the user experience so that it had a guest checkout, Amazon pay, apple pay, and if a user would like to register, then there is that option too. The white background and clean thin lines all create to give the user less clutter. I tested the flow of the shopping cart with Invision User testing and the results showed no frustrations.</p>

						<p>I started out with paper sketches to get a feel of how I would like the homepage to be designed. The design had to be clear and user-friendly.

						<h5 class="section__subtitle">Conclusion</h5>

						<h3 class="section__title">What I learned.</h3>
					</header>

					<div class="section__body size-1">
						<p>Nakedbox is a project that has ultimately helped me become more confident as a generalist designer. I learned that the user research, surveys, competitive analysis, branding, user testing, and wireframing are ingredients in the design process that cannot be ignored. Coming from an Advertising and Visual Design background, one of the biggest lessons I learned was that as a designer, one should always test out an idea. Whether it’s in the concept phase or wireframe phase, it is absolutely vital to have user testing so that problems don’t show up in the final stages. I was corrected by my users, and I knew that even though I felt it was ok, it should never be one-sided or biased. When creating an experience, users are the first priority and our job is to give them a great one.</p>

						<p>Overall, working on this project gave me some struggles, but from those struggles, I gained feasible solutions. That is where the learning started to happen. In considering further development, I would focus on having more variety of boxes sold individually to give users more options. I also see this as a real live product if marketed and developed well. </p>
